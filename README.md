# UPCR
Conversational Recommendation Systems(CRSs) explore user preferences through interactive conversation to make recommendations and generate responses.
In this paper, we propose user Perference Conversational Recommendation (UPCR) for CRSs, which captures long-term and short-term user preferences from history conversations and the current conversation, respectively.
